# Calculators

This project contains two variations of a simple Python calculator program. Both versions perform basic arithmetic operations.

# Features

- Basic operations: Addition, Subtractions, Multiplication, and Division.
- Interactive Interface: The calculator continuously prompts the user for input and displays the result.
- Reusability: The user can continue calculations using the result of the previous operation or restart with a new calculation

# Variations

Calculator with Nested While Loops

- In this variation, the calculated uses a nested while loop to keep the program running while the user performs calculations.

Calculator with Recursion

- In this variation, the calculator uses a recursive function to restart the calculation process.
